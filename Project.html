    <h1>Health Maintenance: Key to a Balanced Life</h1>
    <p id="p1">Maintaining good health is essential for a fulfilling and balanced life.<b> Health maintenance involves adopting habits
    that promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being.</b> Here are a few critical aspects to focus on for overall health:</p>
    <ul>
       <h2><li>Physical Activity</li></h2>

    </ul>

<p id="p1">Regular exercise is vital to keep your body fit and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It helps in maintaining a
healthy weight, improving cardiovascular health, and boosting your mood. <b>Incorporating activities like walking, jogging,
cycling, or even yoga</b> into your daily routine can make a huge difference.</p>  
<ul>
<h2><li>Balanced Diet</li><h2>
</ul>
<p id="p1">A nutritious, well-balanced diet fuels your body and strengthens your<b> immune system</b>. Focus on eating a variety of foods
rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins, and healthy fats. Include fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and
nuts, while avoiding excessive processed and sugary foods.</p>
<ul>
<h2><li>Hydration</li></h4>
</ul>
    <p id="p1">Staying well-hydrated is often overlooked but plays a crucial role in maintaining good health. <b>Water aids in digestion</b>,
    regulates body temperature, and supports overall bodily functions. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily</p>
    <ul>
        <h2><li>Mental Health</li></h2></ul>
    <p id="p1">Mental health is just as important as physical health. <b>Managing stress, getting enough sleep</b>, and practicing mindfulness
    or meditation can significantly improve your mental well-being. Donâ€™t hesitate to seek professional help if needed;
    mental health should never be ignored.</p>
    <ul>
    <h2><li>Sleep</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <p id="p1">Adequate sleep is essential for recovery and maintaining energy levels. Poor sleep can lead to various health issues,
    including fatigue, decreased cognitive function, and a weakened immune system. <b>Aim for 7-9 hours of restful sleep each
    night.</b></p>
